    <h1>Special Characters</h1>
    <p> Since &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; have a special meaning in HTML, you can't use these characters to represemt themselves. Instead you use the so called <q>special characters</q> to represent them. For example, to have a less than sign appear in your document, you need to use < to represent it.
