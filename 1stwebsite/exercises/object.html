<h2>Evil</h2>
<p>By Melanie Martinez</p>

<p>You called the other day, I stayed away
<br>I left your shit on read four times today
<br>And it felt like bliss, used to miss your kiss
<br>Now I'm hop-skip jumpin' over narcissists
<br>Throwing all your stuff into the abyss
<br>Now the role is reversed and told you I'ma switch
<br>How you like my spit?
<br>That's for all the piss that you left me in
<br>See, the horns on my head, they're from goddesses
<br>Goddesses, on God</p>

<p>No, I never knew what it meant
<br>What it meant to be content with you
<br>Everything I expressed, I professed
<br>It never quite made it through
<br>Said it's all in my head, all in my head
<br>Whenever I spoke my truth
<br>No, I won't defend you to all my friends
<br>This time, I refuse</p>

<p>If you bite my hand again
<br>I will never feed you, you can call me evil
<br>Take it to the grave if you wanna play pretend
<br>I won't be mistreated, please call me conceited
<br>Took me way too long to put this to bed
<br>Lovin' you was lethal, guess that makes me evil, evil</p>

<p>Evil, evil, evil,</p>

<p>Remember when you smiled right to my face?
<br>As all my little tears of oxalate
<br>They made a shape, revealed a snake
<br>Now I'm stop-drop rollin' over all your jokes
<br>Every time you tell a lie I'm prayin' that you choke
<br>Should've listened to the signs and the horoscopes
<br>Hope you never cope, hope you slip on soap
<br>Crack your head like an egg, wanna see the yolk
<br>You are such a hoax</p>
